**Difference Between Machine Language and Assembly Language**

| Machine Language                                      | Assembly Language                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Consists of binary code (0s and 1s).                  | Consists of mnemonic codes (e.g., ADD, MOV, SUB).              |
| Directly understood and executed by the CPU.          | Requires an **assembler** to convert it into machine language. |
| Difficult for humans to read, write, and debug.       | Easier for humans to read, write, and debug.                   |
| Example: `10110000 01100001`                          | Example: `MOV AL, 61H`                                         |
| Faster to execute since it is already in binary form. | Must be translated before execution.                           |
| Machine-dependent.                                    | Also machine-dependent, but more user-friendly.                |

### Summary

* **Machine Language** is the lowest-level programming language made up of binary digits (0s and 1s).
* **Assembly Language** is a symbolic representation of machine language that uses mnemonics and labels, making programming easier for humans.

**Example:**

* Machine Language: `10110000 00000101`
* Assembly Language: `MOV AL, 5`

Both languages are **low-level languages**, but assembly language is much easier for programmers to understand and use.
